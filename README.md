# 🥔 Potato Leaf Disease Classification

## 🚀 Project Overview
Potato farmers suffer significant financial losses due to diseases affecting their crops. The most common are **Early Blight** (caused by fungus) and **Late Blight** (caused by microorganisms). Proper early detection and treatment can prevent severe economic damage.

This project leverages **Deep Learning (CNNs)** to automatically classify potato leaf diseases using image data, helping farmers take timely action.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Early identification of **Early Blight** and **Late Blight** in potato leaves is crucial for applying the correct treatment and preventing widespread crop damage. This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to diagnose plant diseases accurately.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy & Pandas**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from Kaggle: [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset).
